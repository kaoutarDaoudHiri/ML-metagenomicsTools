# MACHINE LEARNING FOR CLASSIFICATION OF METAGENOMIC TOOLS
This repository contains all data (raw and preprocessed) and code, used for the Metagenomic tools classification task.
The text classification was performed on two datasets, both covering the same tools and classes :
* **Dataset 1**  using abstract section from the tools scientific publications to describe **85** tools, **9** classes of tools
* **Dataset 2** using abstract and methods sections from the tools scientific publications to describe **85** tools, **9** classes of tools

We trained **4**  classifiers:
* Multinomial Naivee Bayes
* Multinomial Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machines
* Random Forest
